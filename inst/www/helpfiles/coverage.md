## Coverage tracks

***

A nice way to visualize the differences in signal between the defined clusters is
to look at the coverage of each clusters at loci of choices. Clicking on
'Create coverage' will generate BigWig files for each cluster based on the scBED 
files provided. Tracks are normalized by total signal so that large and small 
clusters both have similar signal ranges. This process can take up to ~ 1 min / 500
cells, time is increased with cluster numbers.  
    
Once the tracks are generated, you can vizualise cluster signal at the loci / genes
of interest on the left panel by cliking on "Plot Coverage".
