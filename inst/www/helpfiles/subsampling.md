## Subsampling 

***

Tick this checkbox if you want to randomly subsample your dataset. This enable to both 
reduce the running time to quickly benchmark parameters, and may also ameliorate
clustering & differential analysis as all samples will be represented equally. If
you indicate a number that is lower than the number of cells of any sample, this 
sample won't be subsampled.
