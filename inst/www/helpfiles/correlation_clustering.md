## Correlation Clustering Heatmap

***

This heatmap represents the Pearson's correlation between cells, calculated in
the projection of cells in the lower dimension PC space (first 50 PCs). Red dots
represent high correlation between cells, blue dots represent low correlation 
between cells. A hierarchical clustering dendogramm is represented above and 
cells are ordered according to this clustering.
