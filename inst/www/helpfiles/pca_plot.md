## Output directory

***

This directory will contain all of your analyses. After finishing your first
analysis, if you quit & re-launch ChromSCape later on, selecting the same folder
will allow you to continue all your analyses where you left them.  
More precisely, a folder named 'ChromSCape_analysis' is created where each new 
analysis is a sub-folder.
