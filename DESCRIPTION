Description: ChromSCape - single-cell chromatin landscape profiling - is a ready-to-launch user-friendly Shiny application for the analysis of single-cell epigenomic datasets (scChIP-seq, scATAC-seq...) from raw data to differential analysis & gene set enrichment analysis. It is highly interactive, let user save their analysis and covers the whole single-cell analysis : QC, preprocessing, filtering, dimensionality reduction, vizualisation, clustering, differential analysis, gene set analysis...
