# Installation

**ChromSCape** requires R version 3.5 or higher (does not work on R 4.0 yet).
To install **ChromSCape**, open **R** or **Rstudio** and copy the following commands :

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("vallotlab/ChromSCape")
```

## Launching the application

To launch the application simply run:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ChromSCape)
ChromSCape::launchApp()
```

# What is ChromSCape ?

**ChromSCape** - Single-Cell Chromatin Landscape profiling - is a ready-to-launch 
user-friendly **Shiny** application for analysis of single-cell epigenomic datasets
(scChIP-seq, scATAC-seq...). ChromSCape is used to reveal heterogeneity of chromatin
landscapes within single-cell of one or more samples using dimensionality reduction & 
unsupervised consensus clustering. The user can then interrogate the biological difference
of each epigenomic subpopulation by running differential analysis & gene set enrichment
analysis.  
Various existing technologies allow to produce single-cell genome-wide epigenomic
datasets :  

  * scChIP-seq (Grosselin et al., 2019) CUT&TAG (Kaya-Okur et al., 2019),
 scChIL-seq (Harada et al., 2019), scChIC-seq (Ku et al.,) are technologies that
 isolate DNA sequences attached to histones with specific marks (H3K27me3, H3K4me3)
 or transcription factors (RNA Polymerase 2,...) in single-cells 
  * scATAC-seq (Buenorostro et al., 2015), sciATAC-seq (Cusanovitch et al., 2016) 
 are technologies that allows to asses regions of open chromatin in single-cells

# Step-by-step analysis of single-cell epigenomic data

## 0. Input files 

### Prepare your input files 

#### Count matrices

After sequencing a single-cell epigenomic experiment, the raw sequencing files 
(.fastq) are demultiplexed, aligned against a reference genome to output a count
matrix using a data engineering pipeline specific of the technology. 
For instance, the scChIP-seq raw data produced in (Grosselin et al., 2019) is 
processed using our pipeline [scChIP-seq data engineering](https://github.com/vallotlab/scChIPseq_DataEngineering).
For each cells, reads are counted according to either: 

 * features (extended region around TSS of genes, enhancers)
 * peaks called on bulk or single-cell signal
 * genomic bins (windows of constant length, e.g. 100kbp, 50kbp, 5kbp...)

For the moment, ChromSCape only allows **peaks** or **genomic bins**.

**Matrix format**: ChromSCape expects as input one single-cell count matrix per condition in tab-separated
format (extension .txt or .tsv).  The first column is genomic location in standard
format (chr:start-end) and the next columns are reads counted in each cells
in the corresponding genomic feature. Note that the first entry (row 1, column 1)
must be empty. All files should be placed in the same folder.

<br>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head example_matrix.tsv | cut -f1-5
 	BC969404	BC893525	BC239068	BC073314
chr10:0-50000	0	0	0	0
chr10:50000-100000	0	0	0	0
chr10:100000-150000	0	0	0	0
...
```
  
<br>

#### Alignment BAM files for Peak Calling (**optional**)

For the optional step of Peak Calling on cluster of cells found de novo, 
users have to input one BAM file per sample, placed in the same folder. The barcode
information of each read should be contained in a specific tag (XB, CB..) and correspond
to the column names of the corresponding count matrix.

<br>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
samtools view example_matrix.bam | head
NS500388:436:HNG5VAFXX:2:21311:26430:3816	89	chr10	3102405	255	51M	*	0	0	CTTGGTGTCTAGTGGATCTGCTGCAGTCTTCTGTTGTCAGTGCTAAATCAC	EEEEE/E6EEEAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAA	NH:i:1	HI:i:1	AS:i:50	nM:i:0	XS:i:2147483647	XD:Z:GATGACAAAG	XB:Z:BC969404
...
```
  
  
### Available datasets

Two datasets are available :  

 * **Single-Cell ChIP-seq PDX dataset against H3K27me3**:  
 Input count matrices & BAM files
 corresponding to mouse cells from 2 PDX models, luminal and triple negative
 breast cancer tumours resistant or not to cancer therapy (respectively HBCx_22
 & HBCx_95, see Grosselin et al., 2019). [[scChIP-seq data FigShare](https://figshare.com/articles/PDX_mouse_cells_H3K27me3_scChIP-seq_matrices/12280631)]

 * **Single-cell ATAC seq dataset**:  
 Data from Buenrostro et al., 2015, Corces et al., 2016, Schep et al., 2017 of cell lines & 
 patients sample of various cell types. [[scATAC-seq data FigShare](https://figshare.com/projects/Single-Cell_ChIP-seq_of_Mouse_Stromal_Cells_in_PDX_tumour_models_of_resistance/66419)]]  

  
## 1. Create & import a dataset

Once you have launched the application, you arrive on the "Select & Import". Here you
can selet an output directory, where your analyses will be saved. ChromSCape will 
automatically save the folder's location so that you don't have to select it each
time you connect. 
You must then name your analysis. The name shouldn't contain special characters (except
'_'). Choose either the Human (hg38) or Mouse (mm10) genome. This is used to annotate
your features with the closest genes TSS for the Gene Set Analysis. Browse your 
computer for one or multiple matrices that will be analyzed together. To select
multiple matrices, they must be placed in the same folder and then the user can select
multiples matrices with (Shift + Click) or (Ctrl + Click).   
Finally, clicking  on 'Create Analysis' will create an analysis & import the count matrices
in this analysis. This will create a folder named 'ChromSCape_analyses' in the output 
directory you specified, inside which
another folder 'Your_analysis_name' is nested. If you create another analysis,
it will also be created under 'ChromSCape_analyses'. 
If you already created an analysis in a previous section, selecting the same output
directory as you chose in the previous session will enable you to load your analysis.

## 2. Filter, Normalize & Reduce Dimensionality 

<br>

![<br> <br> **Filter, Normalize & Reduce Tab: ** Adjust paramters to filter out low covered cells & features, as well as too highly covered cells that might be potential doublets. Normalize & Reduce dimensionality using PCA.](../inst/www/Guide_images/Step2_filter_normalize.png)  


## 3. Visualize cells in reduced dimensions 

<br>

![<br> <br> **Visualize Cells: ** Visualize cells in reduced dimensions: PCA, UMAP & TSNE. Color cells by sample, batch, or total count to make sure cells are not separating due to library size only.](../inst/www/Guide_images/Step3_visualize_cells.png) 

## 4. Cluster cells

<br>

![<br> <br> **Cluster Cells: ** Choose a number of cluster if you have clear clusters  of cells, or run  consensus clustering to test multiple clustering and find the optimal cluster number. Optionally filter out lowly correlated cells that might impact the clustering performance.](../inst/www/Guide_images/Step4_1_cluster_cells.png)
