\format{
scExp - a SingleCellExperiment with 106 cells and 5499 features
(genomic bins) in hg38: \describe{ \item{chr}{A SingleCellExperiment} }
}
\usage{
data("scExp")
}
\description{
Data from a single-cell ChIP-seq experiment against H3K4me3 active mark from
two cell lines, Jurkat B cells and Ramos T cells from Grosselin et al., 2019.
The count matrices, on 5kbp bins, were given to ChromSCape and the filtering
parameter was set to 3\% of cells active in regions and subsampled down to
150 cells per sample. After correlation filtering, the experiment is
composed of respectively 51 and 55 cells from Jurkat & Ramos and 5499
5kbp-genomic bins where signal is located.
